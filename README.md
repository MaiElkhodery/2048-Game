## Key Features:
#### -Swipe Controls: Use intuitive swipe gestures to move tiles in four directions - up, down, left, and right. The game leverages the GestureDetectorCompat library for smooth and responsive controls.

#### -Merge and Compress: The heart of the game lies in the merge and compress methods, responsible for combining tiles and collapsing empty spaces on the game board.

#### -Winning Condition: Strategize and plan your moves to reach the elusive 2048 tile. Once you achieve it, you can keep playing to reach even higher scores!

#### -Game Over Detection: The app includes a robust isGameOver method that determines if no more moves are possible, notifying the player when the game is over.

#### -Dynamic Board: The UI is designed using a GridLayout to create a dynamic 4x4 board, adapting to various screen sizes and orientations.

#### -Random Tile Generation: The addRandom method intelligently adds random tiles (2 or 4) to the board after each move, ensuring a fresh and challenging experience.
